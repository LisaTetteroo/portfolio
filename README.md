My portfolio, yes i know the name of the reposotory is spelled wrong. I'm i'm trying to get this as a git-hub page, however it is still a work in progress!!! This is the result of 1 week of selfstudy:
- skillshare class (https://skl.sh/2H822Kn)
- codecademy (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html & https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)

In the process I used GIT, also after learning through skillshare (https://skl.sh/2Sds85h), this was the first time using bash, for a java project I did before this project I used the GitHub desktop version.
